# semantic_html_refactor
Refactoring a marketing agency website to use semantic HTML


## Summary 
I have refactored a website for "Horiseon Inc" in this project. I have factored in the alt text to make the website more accessible for all users. I understand that search engine optimisation s a vital part of the company, so I have even decided to add as many semantic HTML elements as possible by removing the <div> in the previous code. To stop a higher likelihood of having bugs, I have reduced the repeated CSS in the CSS files and ensured that HTML changes are followed through in the CSS.

## About Me 
I am working currently as a Healthcare Support Worker Apprentice in Birmingham. I have always loved computers, and it has been a fascination of mine for life; I 
finally decided to explore my adoration for coding by starting. :nerd_face: :grin: I am passionate about teaching, and I hope that my GitHub repositories will show the expanse of all the knowledge that I  can use to educate others.
